# 2) 9 total lines
# 3) each rule line having 1.000000 as the weight
# 4) 2 lines with C, 1 with A, 2 with E, 1 with Y, 1 with B
#    and 1 with another state in the rhs
BEGIN { FS=" # "; cs=0; es=0; as=0; ys=0; bs=0 sts=0; }
# start state is line 1
NR==1 && $0 !~ /^q[^ ]+[ \t\n\r]*$/ {print NR}
# other lines are well-formed rules with 1.000000 endings
NR>1 && ($1 !~ /^[^ ]+ -> / || $2 != 1.000000) {print NR}
# count number of records
{records++}
END{
